What is an array?
Array is a special variable that can hold more than one value

What are arrays useful for?
Arrays are useful for holding several values such as lists, and can be refered to by an index number

How do you access an array element?
Using index. Example:
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
let car = cars[0]; //expected: Saab 

How do you change an array element?
cars[0] = "Opel"; 

What are some useful array properties?
Arrays can be objects and have different kinds of objects linked to each index number, can be acessed as a whole, length, etc

What are some useful array methods?
Length, sort, push, 

What are loops useful for?
Iterating through data, doing repetitive tasks, etc. 


What is the break statement?
Breaks out of the loop code before all the iterations are completed. 

What is the continue statement?
Similar to break, but breaks only the current iteration of the loop and continue from its beginning. 

What is the advantage of writing automated tests?
Tests can be productive and time saving to test functions created, as well as detecting points of failure in code.

    What is the DOM?
The Document Object Model  is a tree-like representation of the contexts rendered by a browser in a website, a tree of nodes

    How do you target the nodes you want to work with?
document.querySelector, document.getElementById, etc
    
    How do you create an element in the DOM?
using document.createElement('div') as an example;
    
    How do you add an element to the DOM?
Using parentNode.appendChild(childNode) and others; 

    How do you remove an element from the DOM?
parentNode.removeChild(child);
    
    How can you alter an element in the DOM?
using commands like div.setAttribute('id', 'theDiv');
div.removeAttirubte('id');  
    
    When adding text to a DOM element, should you use textContent or innerHTML? Why?
textContent is preferable to avoid JS injection to innerHTML;    
    
    Where should you include your Javascript tag in your HTML file when working with DOM nodes?
 in the header
    
    How do “events” and “listeners” work?
Events are actions that occur on the page, like mouse clicking, keypress, etc. Eventlisteners are built in JS functions that handle events dispatched by eventTargets;
    
    What are three ways to use events in your code?
inline, arrow function on the js file, and using eventListeners    
    
    Why are event listeners the preferred way to handle events?
 eventListeners are better in handling DOM manipulation and have several options      
    
    What are the benefits of using named functions in your listeners?
Naming functions can clean up code as is a good practice. 
    
    How do you attach listeners to groups of nodes?
using document.querySelectorAll and the forEach metode to iterate through each item.
    
    What is the difference between the return values of querySelector and querySelectorAll?
querySelector retuns a single element, while querySelectorAll returns a nodelist of elements that match the selector  
    
    What does a “nodelist” contain?
 Lists of elements; it behaves like an array but lacks functions of array 
 
    Explain the difference between “capture” and “bubbling”.

Capture = When you click on the element, it will go from top to down on the DOM tree. When enabled, run the function on the way down the tree.
Capturing is not widely used and usually is invisible to us

Bubbling = browser figures what you clicked, and everything "zoomed out" of this DOM node is triggered (propagation) => 
When an event happens on an element, it first runs the handlers on it, then on its parent, then all the way up on other ancestors.

What is the difference between objects and arrays?
Objects are arrays with special features: property keys (key-value pairs), additional operators like obj.property, delete obj.prop, key in obj, iterate using (key in obj), and others.

How do you access object properties?
dot notation (person.age, person.name.first) or square brackets (person['age]', person['name'['first']);

What is Array.prototype.map() useful for?
map takes an array, process the array with a function, and return a new array of the same length. Like a factory.

What is Array.prototype.reduce() useful for?
Reduce build something on every single item of the array and returns the processed array. Each iteration retuns the total result before, and the current iteration.
